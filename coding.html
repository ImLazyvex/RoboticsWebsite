                Coding is like the special code language that tells robots what to do. It's like giving them a set of instructions to follow. Imagine if you could write down steps for your robot friend to follow, like "go forward 3 steps" or "turn left." That's what coding does for robots. Coding is super important because it's what makes robots smart and useful. Without coding, robots would just be machines that don't know what to do. But when you code them, they can do all sorts of cool stuff! They can pick up things, move around, and even solve problems. You can make a robot vacuum your room or help doctors in a hospital. The really neat thing is that coding lets you customize robots. You can make them do exactly what you want, kind of like teaching them your own tricks. And that's not all â€“ coding also makes robots do jobs that might be dangerous for people, like going into spaces too small for humans or handling risky materials. So, coding is like the magic wand that brings robots to life. It's how you tell them what to do and make them do amazing things. With coding, robots become like your awesome helpers, doing tasks that make life easier and safer for everyone.
